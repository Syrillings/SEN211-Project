    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
      <span>Surds are irrational numbers that cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. They are
        often expressed using roots, such as square roots, cube roots, and fourth roots.</span>
      <span>Types of Surds:</span>
      <span>- _Simple Surds_: surds that involve only one root, such as √2 or ∛3</span>
      <span>- _Compound Surds_: surds that involve more than one root, such as √(2+√3) or ∛(4-√5)</span>
      <span>- _Mixed Surds_: surds that involve a combination of rational and irrational numbers, such as</span>
      <span>2+√3 or 3-∛2</span>
      <span>Operations on Surds:</span>
      <span>- _Addition and Subtraction_: surds can be added or subtracted by combining like terms, such</span>
      <span>as √2 + √2 = 2√2</span>
      <span>- _Multiplication and Division_: surds can be multiplied or divided by multiplying or dividing the</span>
      <span>numbers inside the roots, such as √2 × √3 = √(2×3) = √6</span>
      <span>- _Rationalization_: surds can be rationalized by multiplying the numerator and denominator by</span>
      <span>a conjugate, such as (√2 + √3) / (√2 - √3)</span>
      <span>Laws of Surds:</span>
      <span>- _Law of Indices_: a^(m/n) = (a^m)^(1/n) = √(a^m)</span>
      <span>- _Law of Surds_: √(ab) = √a × √b</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Simplify the expression: √(4+√16)</span>
      <span>- Rationalize the denominator: (√2 + √3) / (√2 - √3)</span>
      <span>- Evaluate the expression: (√2 × √3) / (√4 + √9)</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Surds:</span>
      <span>- Simplify surds by combining like terms and using the laws of surds.</span>
      <span>- Rationalize denominators by multiplying by a conjugate.</span>
      <span>- Use the laws of indices to simplify expressions involving surds.</span>
