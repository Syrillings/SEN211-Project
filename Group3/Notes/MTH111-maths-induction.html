      <h1>MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION</h1>
    </header>
    <articla class="body-text">
      <span>Mathematical induction is a powerful technique for proving statements about positive integers. It
      involves <br>showing that a statement is true for the smallest possible value, and then showing that
      if it is true for one value, it is also true for the next value.</span>
      <span>Principle of Mathematical Induction:</span>
      <span>- Let P(n) be a statement about the positive integer n.</span>
      <span>- If P(1) is true, and</span>
      <span>- If P(k) implies P(k+1) for all positive integers k, then</span>
      <span>- P(n) is true for all positive integers n.</span>
      <span>Steps in a Proof by Induction:</span>
      <span>1. _Base Case_: show that P(1) is true</span>
      <span>2. _Inductive Hypothesis_: assume that P(k) is true for some positive integer k</span>
      <span>3. _Inductive Step_: show that P(k) implies P(k+1)</span>
      <span>4. _Conclusion_: conclude that P(n) is true for all positive integers n</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Prove that the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers is correct: 1 + 2 + ... + n =</span>
      <span>n(n+1)/2</span>
      <span>- Prove that the statement "2^n > n" is true for all positive integers n</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Mathematical Induction:</span>
      <span>- Clearly state the statement to be proven, P(n).</span>
      <span>- Check the base case, P(1), carefully.</span>
      <span>- Assume the inductive hypothesis, P(k), and use it to prove P(k+1).</span>
      <span>- Avoid common mistakes, such as assuming P(k+1) is true without proving it.</span>
      <span>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</span>
      <span>- Forgetting to check the base case.</span>
      <span>- Assuming the inductive hypothesis is true without proving it.</span>
      <span>- Failing to prove the inductive step.</span>
