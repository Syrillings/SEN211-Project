      <h1>COMPLEX NUMBERS</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
     <span> Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real
      numbers and i is the imaginary unit, satisfying i^2 = -1.</span>
     <span> Definition and Notation:</span>
      <span>- _Complex Number_: a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers</span>
      <span>- _Real Part_: the real number a in the complex number a + bi</span>
      <span>- _Imaginary Part_: the real number b in the complex number a + bi</span>
      <span>- _Modulus_: the distance of the complex number from the origin, denoted as |a + bi|</span>
<span>  - _Argument_: the angle between the positive real axis and the line segment connecting the
  origin to the complex number</span>
      <span>Operations on Complex Numbers:</span>
      <span>- _Addition_: (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i</span>
      <span>- _Subtraction_: (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i</span>
      <span>- _Multiplication_: (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i</span>
      <span>- _Division_: (a + bi)/(c + di) = ((ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)) + ((bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2))i</span>
      <span>- _Conjugate_: the complex number a - bi is the conjugate of a + bi</span>
      <span>- _Modulus and Argument_: the modulus and argument of a complex number can be used to
        represent it in polar form</span>
      
      <span>Applications of Complex Numbers:</span>
      <span>- _Algebra and Geometry_: complex numbers are used to solve algebraic equations and
        represent geometric transformations</span>
      <span>- _Calculus and Analysis_: complex numbers are used to extend the concepts of calculus and
        analysis to complex-valued functions</span>
      <span>- _Physics and Engineering_: complex numbers are used to represent and analyze AC circuits,
        signals, and systems</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Simplify the expression: (2 + 3i)(4 - 5i)</span>
      <span>- Find the modulus and argument of the complex number: 3 + 4i</span>
      <span>- Use complex numbers to solve the equation: x^2 + 4 = 0</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Complex Numbers:</span>
      <span>- Understand the definition and notation of complex numbers.</span>
      <span>- Practice performing operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, and division.</span>
      <span>- Use the properties of complex numbers, such as conjugates and modulus, to simplify
        expressions and solve equations.</span>
