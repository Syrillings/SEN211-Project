      <span>A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, which can be written in the form
        ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants.<br> The roots of a quadratic equation are the
        values of x that satisfy the equation.</span>
<span>Methods for Finding Roots:</span>
<span>- _Factoring Method_: factor the quadratic expression into two binomials, and then set each
  binomial equal to zero to find the roots.</span>
<span>- _Quadratic Formula Method_: use the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a to find the
  roots.</span>
<span>- _Graphical Method_: graph the quadratic function and find the x-intercepts, which represent</span>
<span>the roots.</span>
<span>Types of Roots:</span>
<span>- _Real and Distinct Roots_: two real and distinct values of x that satisfy the equation.</span>
<span>- _Real and Repeated Roots_: two real and equal values of x that satisfy the equation.</span>
<span>- _Complex Roots_: two complex values of x that satisfy the equation.</span>
<span>Quadratic Formula:</span>
<span>- _x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a_: the quadratic formula used to find the roots of a quadratic</span>
<span>equation.</span>
<span>- _Discriminant (b^2 - 4ac)_: the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula,</span>
<span>which determines the nature of the roots.</span>
<span class="examples">Examples:</span>
<span>- Find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 using the factoring method.</span>
<span>- Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.</span>
<span>Tips for Working with Quadratic Equations:</span>
<span>- Check if the quadratic expression can be factored easily.</span>
<span>- Use the quadratic formula when factoring is not possible.</span>
<span>- Always check the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots.</span>
